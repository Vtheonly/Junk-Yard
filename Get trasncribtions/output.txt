start off with a host\n', '\n', 'machine this could be your host now the\n', '\n', 'host could be anything it could be your\n', '\n', 'local PC it could be a server up in the\n', '\n', 'cloud server

works you have things like your\n', '\n', 'CPU you also have things like memory and\n', '\n', "you have your hard drive we'll call this\n", '\n', 'IO now when it comes of virtualization\n', '\n', 'what happens is we take little pieces of\n', '\n', 'each of these pieces of hardware and\n', '\n', 'separate them out into a separate\n', '\n', 'machine this is a virtual machine and\n', '\n', 'then we take these pieces of hardware\n', '\n', 'and in this virtual machine we actually\n', '\n', 'run a full entire operating system now\n', '\n', 'this technique is commonly used in the\n', '\n', "cloud if you're deploying something to\n", '\n', 'AWS or an ec2 instance typically what\n', '\n', "you're doing is you're spinning up a new\n", '\n', 'virtual machine that you can then deploy\n', '\n', 'your code onto now virtual machines have\n', '\n', 'a special type of program that can run\n', '\n', 'and manage the life cycle of these\n', '\n', 'machines this program is called a\n', '\n', 'hypervisor and the hypervisor is in\n', '\n', 'charge of virtual machines it manages\n', '\n', 'the life cycle it starts them up it\n', '\n', 'stops them it creates them it deletes\n', '\n', 'them it

based around so let's\n", '\n', 'talk about containerization in a\n', '\n', 'container setup what you would do is you\n', '\n', 'would have a host PC much like the\n', '\n', 'virtualization setup that

use some\n', '\n', 'techniques like the CH root command\n', '\n', 'which will create a new route for a\n', '\n', 'process so it can only live inside that\n', '\n', "root and it can't touch anything outside\n", '\n', 'of that like any of the other users\n', '\n', 'directories or things like that that are\n', '\n', 'already on the system we could also use\n', '\n', 'a kernel feature like the r

containerization now\n', '\n', 'with containerization you could do all\n', '\n', "this manually yourself but it's really\n", '\n', 'difficult and pretty tricky so there are\n', '\n', 'programs that help manage the life cycle\n', '\n', 'of your containers this is where Docker\n', '\n', 'comes into play Docker is a program that\n', '\n', 'manages the life cycles of containers\n', '\n', 'edit them

how to then run containers from the\n', '\n', 'images we have to talk about something\n', '\n', 'called a Docker file this is an example\n', '\n', "doer file and it's pretty contrived but\n", '\n', 'essentially what you would have with any\n', '\n', 'project anything you want to build an\n', '\n', 'image out of is you would have a\n', '\n', 'directory structure that looks something\n', '\n', 'like this in this contrived example we\n', '\n', 'have a directory that can contains a\n', '\n', 'Docker file and within the docker file\n', '\n', "we have a coffee recipe folder let's\n", '\n', 'just imagine that this is a coffee\n', '\n', 'recipe application of some sort in this\n', '\n', 'coffee recipe folder we have two scripts\n', '\n', 'prepare Beans and Brew Coffee okay so\n', '\n', "now let's talk about what this Docker\n", '\n', 'file is doing you can see on this very\n', '\n', 'first line we have from Ubuntu latest\n', '\n', 'now you might remember this terminology\n', '\n', 'from not too long ago that means that we\n', '\n', 'want to use the Ubuntu image at the\n', '\n', 'latest tag this is the terminology for\n', '\n', 'an image and the tag for that image\n', '\n', 'Ubuntu latest okay great the next line\n', '\n', 'says we want to run appt get update and\n', '\n', 'appt get install some contrived package\n', '\n', 'what is this this line tells Docker that\n', '\n', 'we want to run something on the image\n', '\n', "that was added above so we're running\n", '\n', 'apt get update and apt get install on\n', '\n', 'our auntu latest image so this runs\n', '\n', 'command on the image next what we want\n', '\n', 'to do is copy the coffee recipe\n', '\n', 'directory from our local file system\n', '\n', 'into this image so what we want to do\n', '\n', 'here is basically just copy things from\n', '\n', 'our local directory again you can\n', '\n', 'remember our directory structure looks\n', '\n', 'like this we have the coffee recipe\n', '\n', 'directory and under this we have a\n', '\n', 'couple of scripts so we want to copy the\n', '\n', 'coffee recipe directory into this image\n', '\n', 'next we want to run in our image the\n', '\n', 'script prepare beans. sh so this will\n', '\n', 'run that script now remember since we\n', '\n', 'copied the directory into our image we\n', '\n', 'will have this available to us because\n', '\n', 'prepared beans is right here oh look I\n', '\n', 'misspelled it how fun and then next we\n', '\n', 'have this line that says command Now\n', '\n', 'command is the default command that this\n', '\n', "container is going to run it's this can\n", '\n', 'be overwritten in the CLI but by default\n', '\n', "we're going to run the Brew Coffee\n", '\n', 'command this is the default command for\n', '\n', 'our Docker image so when the darker\n', '\n', "container runs it's going to run this\n", '\n', "default command so now let's zoom out a\n", '\n', 'little bit here what we are going to do\n', '\n', 'is we are going to take in this\n', '\n', 'contrived example this Docker file and\n', '\n', 'from this Docker file we are going to\n', '\n', 'build a Docker image now this image we\n', '\n', "could name anything but let's just call\n", '\n', 'it coffee right this image by default\n', '\n', 'will create will be called coffee at the\n', '\n', 'latest tag you can give an image\n', '\n', 'whatever tag you want but again by\n', '\n', 'default Docker gives a tag of latest to\n', '\n', 'every image now this image is almost\n', '\n', 'like the file system for the container\n', '\n', "to run and it's immutable you can only\n", '\n', "build one image you don't change your\n", '\n', 'images what you do if you want to change\n', '\n', 'anything is you change your Docker file\n', '\n', 'and then build a new version of your\n', '\n', 'image for containers to run now from our\n', '\n', 'image what we want to do is we want to\n', '\n', 'call Docker run and that will then run\n', '\n', 'our container and our container as we\n', '\n', 'said before will call the Run command\n', '\n', 'that we specified in our darker file\n', '\n', 'which was Brew coffee.\n', '\n', 'sh and again to actually build the image\n', '\n', 'we want to run Docker build and there\n', '\n', 'are certain Flags we can pass to build\n', '\n', 'like I said to change the tag of the\n', '\n', 'image from the default of latest you can\n', '\n', 'also name the image whatever you want\n', '\n', 'but this is generally the process for\n', '\n', 'Docker we want to create a Docker file\n', '\n', 'in some repository or in our directory\n', '\n', 'we want to then use this Docker file as\n', '\n', 'the instructions to build a new image\n', '\n', 'for Docker then we can run this image\n', '\n', 'and Docker will spin up a new container\n', '\n', 'on our system that is not able to touch\n', '\n', 'anything else within our system and it\n', '\n', 'will run whatever code we want it to run\n', '\n', 'using the command flag so that in a\n', '\n', 'nutshell is how Docker sets up Docker\n', '\n', 'files images and containers okay so now\n', '\n', 'we have all of our Core Concepts in\n', '\n', 'place we understand the relationship\n', '\n', 'between a Docker file how a Docker file\n', '\n', 'is the instructions to build a Docker\n', '\n', 'image and then how a Docker image is\n', '\n', 'used to then run a Docker container all\n', '\n', 'underneath the umbrella of the docker\n', '\n', "CLI so let's get our hands dirty and\n", '\n', 'actually try out a real world example\n', '\n', 'this is going to be a simple example\n', '\n', "it's a contrived example yet again but\n", '\n', "we're actually going to run a real\n", '\n', 'container on our system to get a feel\n', '\n', "for how the docker CLI works now let's\n", '\n', 'just say I have a directory called\n', '\n', 'Docker example and in this directory I\n', '\n', 'have two files a Docker file and a print\n', '\n', "message. sh file let's take a look at\n", '\n', "them let's start first with our print\n", '\n', 'message. sh we can see that it is a bash\n', '\n', 'script and then it has a variable that\n', '\n', 'has a list of phrases these phrases are\n', '\n', 'then randomly selected and we print them\n', '\n', 'out to the terminal using a a program\n', '\n', "called figlet now what if I don't have\n", '\n', 'figlet installed on my local machine\n', '\n', "well that's okay that's why we have this\n", '\n', 'Docker file so in our Docker file what\n', '\n', "we want to do as we've seen before we\n", '\n', 'want to use auntu latest that means\n', '\n', "we're using the latest version of the\n", '\n', 'auntu image from Docker probably from\n', '\n', 'Docker Hub then on that image we want to\n', '\n', 'run apt get update and apt get install\n', '\n', "figlet and wget we're going to use WG\n", '\n', 'get in the next line where we run W get\n', '\n', 'and we W get some fonts that we want to\n', '\n', 'then install on our system then we want\n', '\n', 'to copy our local print message script\n', '\n', 'into the Container for print m.sh this\n', '\n', "is what we're actually going to run then\n", '\n', 'we want to chamod plus X print m.sh that\n', '\n', 'just makes this script executable inside\n', '\n', 'of the container and our final command\n', '\n', "is to just run print message. SSH it's a\n", '\n', 'pretty simple Docker file but this will\n', '\n', 'give us an understanding of how to use\n', '\n', 'these things in real time so now that\n', '\n', "we're within this directory that has a\n", '\n', 'doer file we can call from within the\n', '\n', 'directory Docker build now in Docker\n', '\n', 'build we could tag that by default it\n', '\n', 'will tag it with the latest release and\n', '\n', 'we can call this asky and we want to\n', '\n', 'make sure we build everything in this\n', '\n', 'current directory this will build our\n', '\n', "very first image let's see what this\n", '\n', 'command does okay this was a lot of\n', '\n', "stuff but let's just go through it\n", '\n', 'really quickly and see what we did here\n', '\n', 'we can see that it sent the build\n', '\n', 'context to the docker Damon and then we\n', '\n', 'did the steps that were in the docker\n', '\n', 'file we can see the docker file working\n', '\n', 'for us step one out of six from auntu\n', '\n', 'latest now it pulls from Library auntu\n', '\n', 'this is probably pulling from dockerhub\n', '\n', 'we then run appt get update and app get\n', '\n', 'install these couple of programs onto\n', '\n', 'our abtu image very good we can see that\n', '\n', "that is running and that's what all this\n", '\n', 'output is and then in our next step step\n', '\n', 'three we want to run W get for these\n', '\n', 'files now these files were then taken\n', '\n', 'and saved into this image very good and\n', '\n', 'now in step four out of six we copy our\n', '\n', 'local print message script into the\n', '\n', 'image then we run chamod plus X which\n', '\n', 'will make it executable and at the very\n', '\n', 'end we want to make sure our default\n', '\n', 'command is just by running this print\n', '\n', 'message script cool okay so now we have\n', '\n', 'our image built how do we run the\n', '\n', 'container based on this image well what\n', '\n', 'we can do is we can check what images we\n', '\n', 'have currently built on our system with\n', '\n', 'the docker images command we hit enter\n', '\n', 'and we can see that amongst a couple\n', '\n', 'others like Ubuntu and hello world we\n', '\n', 'have our asky image tagged at the latest\n', '\n', 'tag with an image ID created about a\n', '\n', "minute ago and that's what we have right\n", '\n', "here we built our image I'm going to\n", '\n', "make my font smaller here because we're\n", '\n', "printing out asky text and it's going to\n", '\n', "be pretty large on the screen you'll see\n", '\n', 'what I mean in a second but basically\n', '\n', 'what we want to do is now that we have\n', '\n', 'our image built we can run Docker run\n', '\n', 'and then type the name of the image\n', '\n', 'which is asky we could also optionally\n', '\n', 'add the tag which would be latest and\n', '\n', "I'll just add it right here if we do\n", '\n', 'this and enter Then This command we can\n', '\n', 'see that it actually runs the container\n', '\n', 'and it runs the script that prints out\n', '\n', "asky art to our screen isn't that\n", '\n', "awesome so basically what we've done\n", '\n', 'here is we have now a Docker file that\n', '\n', 'installs STS things into an image we\n', '\n', 'have an image that has all these\n', '\n', 'programs on it like figlet w get and\n', '\n', 'everything else and then it has a script\n', '\n', 'inside of that image as well now the\n', '\n', "container runs and the container's\n", '\n', 'default command is to then print this\n', '\n', "stuff out to the terminal and that's\n", '\n', 'what it is we just did that awesome now\n', '\n', 'we can keep running this command we can\n', '\n', 'keep running this Docker container and\n', '\n', 'it will just randomly select another\n', '\n', 'thing apparently it was the same for a\n', '\n', 'bunch of those but it will select random\n', '\n', 'sayings and then print them out in an\n', '\n', "asky text to us very cool but now let's\n", '\n', 'say we want to modify this script and we\n', '\n', 'want to print out different things what\n', '\n', 'do we do now to update this image well\n', '\n', "images are immutable what you're going\n", '\n', 'to have to do is edit your Docker file\n', '\n', 'and then create a new image probably\n', '\n', "with a different tag let's get into that\n", '\n', 'so we see we have our Docker file here\n', '\n', "and we have our print message. sh let's\n", '\n', 'just say we want to change some of these\n', '\n', 'phrases this is\n', '\n', 'fun I love\n', '\n', "Docker cool okay so now we've changed\n", '\n', 'the script that actually prints the\n', '\n', "messages out what we're going to want to\n", '\n', 'do is build a new image from this Docker\n', '\n', 'file because this new image is going to\n', '\n', "contain different things okay so let's\n", '\n', 'do Docker\n', '\n', 'build- T and what we want to do is we\n', '\n', 'want to name this asky with a colon the\n', '\n', "colon is going to denote the tag and I'm\n", '\n', 'just going to call it different we can\n', '\n', 'call whatever we want and we want to\n', '\n', 'build it from our local directory now\n', '\n', "let's hit enter so we can see here we\n", '\n', 'get very similar output to what we had\n', '\n', 'before we probably get less output\n', '\n', 'because we already have the ab image\n', '\n', 'installed and we already have these\n', '\n', 'programs installed in the abutu image\n', '\n', 'that Docker is using to build this image\n', '\n', "but we can see down below we've\n", '\n', 'successfully built this new image which\n', '\n', "has a new ID and there's a new tag\n", '\n', 'called asky different very cool all\n', '\n', "right so now let's check Docker images\n", '\n', 'to see what this looks like okay great\n', '\n', "we can see that we have as's latest\n", '\n', "build which isn't currently the latest\n", '\n', 'because we tagged it with something\n', '\n', "different but that's okay for now and we\n", '\n', 'have our new asky different tag so this\n', '\n', 'tag is a snapshot of our Docker file\n', '\n', 'that was built into an image so now\n', '\n', "let's run our new image in a container\n", '\n', 'we can call Docker run asky and we want\n', '\n', "to add the tag of different let's see\n", '\n', 'what happens you can see it pushes out\n', '\n', 'the different text that we did now we\n', '\n', "have different sayings that we're\n", '\n', 'putting out there like I love you or I\n', '\n', "love Docker let's make this a little bit\n", '\n', 'smaller so we can see it a little bit\n', '\n', 'better but I love Docker this is fun I\n', '\n', 'love you these are all the different\n', '\n', 'messages that we put in our print\n', '\n', 'message Dosh now the cool thing is we\n', '\n', 'still have the previous version of this\n', '\n', "image like I said they're immutable you\n", '\n', "don't change the images you just create\n", '\n', 'new ones so we can also say

what have\n', '\n', "we learned here well I think we've\n", '\n', "learned a lot we've learned about the\n", '\n', 'difference between virtualization and\n', '\n', "containerization and we've also
