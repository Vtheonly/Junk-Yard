free youtube transcriptf Thinking Every Student MUST Masterw.youtube.com/watch/1xqerXscTsEthere are six levels or types ofthinking that every student or learnerof any age should master and each ofthese six levels leads to a differentlevel of result unfortunately most ofthe students I work with stuck in thesefirst few levels of thinking and thereason that they struggle to reach topresults is because they are thinking atthe wrong level when this happens itcauses a lot of stress it wastes a lotof time it can be very frustrating itfeel impossible to reach top resultswith any degree of confidence and withenough time we can start thinking thatmaybe we're just not cut out for it butthat probably is not true and for melearning how to think deliberately atthe right level is one of the mainreasons I was able to achieve topacademic results in both medical schooland for my masters of education andtrust me I'm certainly not a genius I'veseen similar results with thousands ofstudents and professionals that havetrained over years and by the end ofthis video you'll be able to see whatlevel you tend to operate at and how youcan get to the level that you need to beand FYI the level you need to be isprobably higher than you think but we'llget to that later so the first level isall about memorizing things thisinvolves a lot of rereading uh rewritingit is usually very repetitive it canfeel very tedious it often makes us feeldrowsy and this level is calledremember it is the level of rootelearning and repeating hundreds andthousands of flash cards this is the wayI and maybe you studied for like most ofHigh School uh and it's maybe the reasonwhy you might have hated studying andwhen you do this level of thinking andstudying then it unlocks level oneresult which isregurgitate the regurgitate level is allabout listing defining stating factsit's the kinds of questions that areless common as you go through ourUniversity and become semi useless inprofessional life confusingly eventhough this first level is calledremember it's actually not a very goodway to hold on to and retain the thingsthat you learn uh but we'll talk aboutthat later the second level of learningis about really trying to comprehendwhat you are learning rather than justlike repeatedly smash it into your brainthis is the level that we callunderstand now there's a reason I'vebeen saying these are levels of thinkinguh and not different levels of studyingand that's because your intentionsreally matter you could have two peopledoing exactly the same technique and forsomeone looking at you it can lookexactly the same and then when you askthem hey how are you studying they mightboth just say I'm just reading mytextbook but mentally it's different forthe person at level one by reading theyactually mean mean I'm reading it againand again so I can try to get it stuckin my head whereas for the person inlevel two what they mean is I'm readingit so I can understand what it's tryingto say and wrap my head around it and sonaturally at level two thinkingunderstand what we unlock is level tworesult which isexplain this allows us to answerquestions that require us to explain ourunderstanding of a concept or a processthese these types of questions oftenmake up the bulk of most assessments upuntil around later in uni now if this issounding familiar to you so far it'sbecause it's described in a frameworkcalled Bloom's revised taxonomy whichwas first published in1956 and then later revised in 2001 andeven though it is 70 years old uh it isstill one of the most underratedprinciple that most students have neverheard of and if you have heard of itstick around because I'll teach you away of using it that helped me double mylearning efficiency so level three isabout using what you have leared to thensolve problems and this is a level thatwe call apply now this is where thingscan get a little bit confusing because alot of people misunderstand this aboutBloom's tonomy there are lots ofdifferent ways that you can apply yourknowledge to solve problems so forexample you have what we I would say aresimple problems uh these are the typesof problems where you learn somethingand then you just directly use thatthing that you learned to solve aproblem so for example in math orphysics you learn an equation or formulaand there is a problem that you need tosolve by just using that equation orformula then again there are what Imight call a little bit more advancedproblems and these are the ones whereyou actually have to think about thebest way to tackle the problem there area combination of Concepts that you needto apply in a certain sequence andthere's a lot more strategic thinkinginvolved at level three we are mostlytalking about the first one simpleproblem solving and so we unlock thatlevel which is the simple problemsolving result we're now able to solvewhat I call One to One problems wherethere is one concept you learn and theproblem requires that one concept tosolve and you can get to this levellevel three by just literally solvingquestions and solving problems lots ofpractice papers and quizzes havequestions at the apply level forsomething more procedural like coding itmight be building a simple function witha few simple variables but what aboutthe harder and more complex questionsthe types of problems that are Advancedthis is where level four thinking comesin we're entering into the territory ofhigher order learning people who knowhow to think at level four tend to dopretty well but level four thinkers arenot common and you'll see why why thatis soon level four thinking is all aboutcomparing and contrasting it's aboutlooking for similarities and differenceswe call this level analyze it's thefirst time that we're not just lookingat information by itself but we'relooking at it in relation to anotherpiece of information and there arecountless techniques that help withlevel four analyze Vin diagrams makingtables making summaries that explain thesimilarities and differences using mindmaps so in problems and questions thatforce you to compare one Concept inrelation to another all of these thingsare going to be helpful really anytechnique is effective as long as itforces you to compare and contrast onething against another thing so unlockinglevel four accesses the level fourresult which is the comparison level andinstead of just giving you some examplesof what comparison looks like like I'mgoing to do one bit and show you thisgreat little study tip that you can usego on to something like chbt or Geminiand type in this prompt give mequestions at the educational stage thatyou want so let's say second yearuniversity level for the subject solet's say in this example we'll say uhmicrobiology at blooms revised taxonomylevel in this case it's going to belevel four and these are exactly thetypes of questions that test you atlevel four and you'll see that everysingle option forces you to compareideas against each other now the reasonthat this technique is actually usefulto use in your studying is becauseBloom's revised taxonomy was not createdfor people like you like a learner theywere created for educators and examwriters and internationally almost everysingle curriculum is designed aroundBloom's taxonomy or a similar taxonomythey're all pretty similar to each otherwhich means your exam writer is thinkingin this way to create the questions thatare going to filter out the good versusthe great Learners which means you cannow predict the types of questionsthey're going to ask you and even createyour own practice papers but here is whylevel four thinkers are not common assoon as you jump from level three tolevel four you will 100% notice thatthis level of thinking requires moremental effort it is harder to do you'rethinking for longer and more deeply thanthe previous levels which is a goodthing because it means that your brainis forming deeper knowledge and strongermemory but it can feel like you'vegotten slower and some people think thatthat means they're doing something wrongso even though most students can thinkat level four most students choose notto because it doesn't feel as easy thisis a phenomenon called themisinterpreted effort hypothesis and itprevents the majority of Learners fromever really improving and this is evenmore the case at level five level fivethinking is for the top Learners if youcan think at level five you will bereaching those top results it's also thelevel that people find the mostconfusing so I'm going to make it reallysimple for you level five is all aboutJudgment at level four we analyzed wecompared and contrasted we foundsimilarities and differences at levelfive we're asking so what what does itmatter who cares why is it importantlevel five is calledevaluate and learning to think at thislevel unlocks the level five resultwhich isprioritize so let's do that little AItrick again and see the difference inthe types of questions we get so you cansee level four on the left and levelfive on the right so notice that atlevel five we are forming conclusionsand now we have to justify it it's notenough like at level four just to knowthat there are similarities anddifferences we then have to use thatknowledge to make a decision level fivethinking takes much more effort uh andyou'll know that you are doing it rightwhen you are going back and forthbetween the material trying to answerthe question in your head of why doesthis matter how does it fit in witheverything else why do I need to careyou're going to be jumping between yourlectures and your textbook and doing aGoogle search these are the signs thatyou are operating at level five and it'snot as easy as the previous levels butto reach level five results you need togo through this and level four and levelfive are the types of questions andchallenges you'll find in second andthird year university and Beyond on uhand in postgrad studies most of whatyou're assist at is level four and levelfive also pretty much any seniorposition in any profession will requireyou to have level four and level fivethinking and much like before it's lessabout what your Technique looks like andmore about what's happening inside yourbrain for example for level five mindmaps uh teaching answering questions uhcreating summaries these are alltechniques that are great for level fivebut you could also do all of thosetechniques and still not do it at levelfive if you're not thinking in the rightway for example it's easy to make a mindmap just connecting a bunch of lines andarrows together between words forming afew groups and categories here and thereand just call it done but that's notlevel five thinking it's very differentto for example creating a mind map whereyou're critically evaluating which linesand relationships are more importantthan other possible relationships andyou're thinking what is the best way Ican group these ideas together mentallyit's a very different process eventhough physically it can look verysimilar now level six I'll go throughthis one pretty quickly because finallyenough it's actually less important formost people level six is about creatinga hypothesis it's about synthesizing newand novel information from what youalready know this level is called createand when you unlock create it unlocksthe level six result which ishypothesize now some people think thatlevel six create is any situation whereyou have to generate anything with yourknowledge uh this is not true it's onlylevel six if you are creating a answerfor something that you don't think theanswer exists in your knowledge alreadyyou're identifying a gap and you'recreating a potential answer that makessense based on what you do know and thereason level six is not as important asthe previous levels is because mostpeople will not really be assisted uh atlevel six unless you are at the highestlevels of Education or your professionmost people in their daily lives will beat the top of their game just being ableto perform at level five consistentlybut just for your knowledge here aresome examples of level six and as youcan see it's pretty Advanced you canpause to read this a little bit more ifyou like or you can jump onto your AIand do this for your own subject nowhere's the part that is going to blowyour mind if you want to get to levelfive and level six there are actuallytwo different methods to get there thefirst way is to start studying and justto go through each level from bottom totop first you remember it and then youunderstand it and then you apply it andthen you analyze it so on and so forththis sounds very logical but for mostpeople this will not work the problemwith starting at the bottom masteringlevel one then mastering level two thenmastering level three Etc is that it isvery very time consuming and most peopledo not have enough time to even reachlevel five let alone Master it so inreality most people will just do alittle bit of each level kind of backand forth like for example in lecturesthey might be doing little bit of levelone and then a little bit of level twoand then later when doing some quizzesthey might be doing a bit of level twoand a little bit of level three and justsort of moving back and forth if they doa more challenging question they'll bedoing a little bit of level four andthen level five and this doesn't reallywork very well because we will alwaysforget things over time in research wecall this phenomenon knowledge Decay itoccurs because the memory has somethingcalled a forgetting curve so basicallywhile you're doing level two and levelthree our knowledge of level one willslowly Decay away right we're going toforget it and so instead of being ableto actually just move up the levelswe're going to be spending most of ourtime just relearning the things that wecontinuously forget so instead here isthe better way to reach the higherlevels instead of starting at level oneand moving up we're going to start atlevel five and actually move downremember level five because level six isnot relevant for most people and thereason this works is because our brainactually processes information and formsmemory more strongly at level five thanit does at level one and when we set oursights at the top our brain willactually fill in and achieve the lowerlevels of results along the way asalmost like a side effect and thisdoesn't work the other way around if weare trying to just learn so that we canregurgitate material our brain is notgoing to then be able to automaticallycompare or prioritize information but ifwe are trying to compare and prioritizethen we will gain better memory so thatwe can if we need to regurgitate explainand solve problems now by the way thescience on this gets a little bitcomplicated so if you want me to godeeper in on this then let me know inthe comments like I said level fivetakes more mental effort but it pays offbig time by forgetting less so thismeans when we start studying don't focuson trying to remember or understandFocus most of your attention on tryingto evaluate which forces you tounderstand and analyze it in the firstplace now if
