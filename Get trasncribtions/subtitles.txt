read The Words If by Roger Kipling that
3:20
I often return to when I feel lost and
3:24
I'm looking for guidance on how to be a
3:25
better
3:27
man if you can keep your head when all
3:30
about you are losing theirs and blaming
3:32
it on you if you can trust yourself when
3:34
all men doubt you but make allowance for
3:36
their doubting too if you can wait and
3:39
not be tired by waiting or being lied
3:41
about don't deal in lies or being hated
3:45
don't give way to hating and yet don't
3:47
look too good nor talk too wise if you
3:50
can dream and not make dreams your
3:52
master if you can think and not make
3:54
thoughts your aim if you can meet with
3:57
Triumph and disaster and treat those
3:59
Impostors just the same if you can bear
4:02
to hear the truth you've spoken Twisted
4:05
by naves to make a trap for fools or
4:08
watch the things you gave your life to
4:11
broken and stoop and build them up with
4:14
worn out tools if you can make one heap
4:17
of all your winnings and risk it on one
4:20
turn of pitch and toss and lose and
4:24
start again at your beginnings and never
4:27
breathe a word about your loss
4:29
if you can force your heart and nerve
4:31
and Sen you to serve your turn long
4:35
after they're gone and so hold on when
4:38
there's nothing in you except the will
4:41
which says to them hold on if you can
4:44
talk with crowds and keep your virtue or
4:47
walk with Kings nor lose the common
4:49
touch if neither foes nor loving friends
4:52
can hurt you if all men count with you
4:55
but none too
4:57
much if you can fill the unforgiving
5:00
minute with 60 seconds worth of distance
5:03
run yours is the Earth and everything
5:06
that's in it and which is more you'll be
5:09
a man my
5:11
son thank you for listening and see you
