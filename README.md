# Junk-Yard

A collection of small scripts I use for various tasks, mostly for automation, file creation/movement, and batch renaming. Some scripts are focused on productivity, while others are for automation.

Some scripts are experimental, testing new technologies like the SDXL API or tools from GitHub. Others are underdeveloped, unpolished code that works by fine-tuning variables here and there.

Feel free to use themâ€”may the code be with you!
